# Emerging Technologies Project

## Introduction
This repository was developed as a project for the module Emerging Technologies as part of a Software Developement Degree in GMIT. The project involves writing documentation, code, and comments in the programming language Python and using the Jupyter notebook software. The purpose of this project was to engage in new technologies and machine learning techniques.

## Goals
The goal of this repository is to create, document, and train a model that recognises hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset. Create a web application that allows a user to draw a digit using their mouse or touchscreen device. The drawing should then be then be submitted for recognition to the model you have trained above. This should be done using the flask Python package.

## Prerequisities
In order to debug this Application you must have **Anaconda** installed. Anaconda is a popular Python data science platform
[How to install Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html) Make sure to add Anaconda to your system path.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Downloading the project

#### Using GIT
Ensure Git is installed https://git-scm.com/downloads
avigate to target directory of project in CMD
Git clone https://github.com/CormacRaftery/EmergingTechnologies.git

#### Run this project
To run this programme, there are a few things you must set up. You must have:

Anaconda installed -> Install anaconda Install tensorflow -> Open an administrator cmd and type "conda install tensorflow" Install opencv -> Open an administrator cmd and type "conda install opencv" Install keras -> Open an administrator cmd and type "conda install keras"

It is important to run all commands in an Administrator Command Prompt

To run this program, you must open command prompt in the directory with FlaskApp.py and input the following:

python FlaskApp.py

You must then open a web browser and go to localhost:5000

### Run The Jupyter notebooks
Navigate to the project directory and enter following command:
jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook will launch in the browser.
